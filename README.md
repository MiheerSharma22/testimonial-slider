# Overview
This is a React.JS project to deepen my understanding and improve my hands-on experience of React.js and its useState() hook.<br>
This one also helped me to make the understanding of concepts like states, props and prop-drilling in React, more concrete.

# Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>React.JS</li>
</ul>

# Install and Run
<ul>
  <li>git clone https://github.com/MiheerSharma22/testimonial-slider.git
  <li>cd testimonial-slider</li>
  <li>npm install</li>
  <li>npm install react-icons</li>
  <li>npm run start</li>
</ul>

# Demo
See the <a href="https://testimonials-slider-app.netlify.app/">live action here</a>.

# My Learnings
<ul>
  <li>Got to brainstorm, improvise and code the logic of how a slider actually works.</li>
  <li>Got my core concepts of React.JS stronger and became much more comfortable working with states and props in React.</li>
</ul>
